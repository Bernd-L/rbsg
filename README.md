# rbsg

Rust-based social graph

FYI: This project is in its early design & idea phase, and it'll be a long while until the first beta will be ready.

## Purpose

This application should eventually provice overview over one's contacts.

It should consist of a [actix](https://actix.rs/) server and a [yew](https://yew.rs/docs/en/intro/) frontend communicating via an HTTP(S) API and store its data in a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) database.
